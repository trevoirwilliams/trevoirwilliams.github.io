PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. 

The 'P' in PHP is present in the acronym LAMP which is short for: <br/>
L - Linux<br/>
A - Apache<br/>
M - MySQL (recently MariaDB)<br/>
P - PHP (sometimes Perl)<br/>

XAMPP gives us an all-in-one installer for this stack (X meaning it's available on other operating systems).
