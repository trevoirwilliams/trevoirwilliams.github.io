In our [previous lesson](https://trevoirwilliams.github.io/2019-10-19-php-form/), we setup a form with a modern look and feel using Bootstrap 4 and JQueryUI classes and widgets. 

In this lesson, we will explore life after the form. What happens when we click submit. PHP allows us to track all the value that were entered in the form and manipulate them thereafter. This is the first step towards being able to save data submitted from a form.
