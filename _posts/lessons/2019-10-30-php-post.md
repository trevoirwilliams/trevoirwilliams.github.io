In our [previous lesson](https://trevoirwilliams.github.io/2019-10-25-php-get/), we added a form method of 'get' and we able to view all the data submitted on the form, on an action page. This was a good introduction to what happens after a for gets submitted, but is not recommended when dealing with sensitive data. 

In this lesson, we will explore the 'post' method which hides the data being submitted from plain sight and still allows us to view it on the action page. This is a more recommended method when submitting sensitive and personal information.
