In our [previous lesson](https://trevoirwilliams.github.io/2019-10-30-php-post/), we added a form method of 'post' that allowed us to transport our submitted form data to a second (or action) page in a discreet manner. 

In this lesson, we begin to design a database that will have the tables we need to store the records that are being submitted. A database will allow us to persist our data. This way, we can view, update and delete this data at will at a later date.
