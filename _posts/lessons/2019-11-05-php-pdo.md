In our [previous lesson](https://trevoirwilliams.github.io/2019-11-04-phpMyAdmin-design/), we created a database for our application using phpMyAdmin. Now we need to connect to this database from our web application. This connection will allow us to build interfaces that abstract the data to the web interface and allow us to manipulate it at will.

In this lesson, we begin to supporting code to our application to facilitate the database connection.
