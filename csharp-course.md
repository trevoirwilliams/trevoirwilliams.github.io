    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Web applications with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.
    </li>
    <li>
    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Native iOS and Android mobile apps using Xamarin.
    </li>
    <li>
    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Libraries, components, and console applications
    </li>
    <li>
    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Cloud and Azure apps
    </li>
    <li>
    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Block chain apps
    </li>
    <li>
    <i class="fa fa-check light-green" aria-hidden="true"></i> Not only is C# language supported and maintained by Microsoft, but it also has a strong community support. More than 5 million developers use C# language. .NET Core and C# compiler are open source and the adoption is growing in open source community.
    </li>
</ul>

This course is practical and will equip you with all you need to build a fully functional web application, add it to source control using GitHub and finally, host it on Heroku.

#### Content and Overview
This course is very beginner friendly and chock full of development tips. This huge course offers premium content, smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.

By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and impress your boss and coworkers.

The course is complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.
