#### Overview
Learn how to build a RESTful API for a book store's database using ASP.Net Core 3.1 API, Entity Framework, the Repository Pattern and various other tools and services for testing and logging. This complete course will show you how to use Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server Express and explore consuming a REST API in a .NET application. 

By the end of the course, we would have built a single page application using Blazor. We will look at parsing and storing JWT information and using it across our application for user authentication and authorization. We will also look at how we communicate with API's in our application. 

ASP.NET Core 3.1 is Microsoft's modern, cross-platform framework for building enterprise ready web applications. In this course,  you will learn everything you need to know about building a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core 3.1, from understanding the folder structure and files, to building a complete web API. 
 

#### Why Learn ASP.NET Core 3.1
Microsoft .NET is the platform that drives the business technology of many of the top corporations in the United States and many other countries. It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support.

The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It’s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.

#### Why Develop With Blazor?
The most popular JavaScript client-side web frameworks have been Angular, React, Vue and others. In this course, we keep it .NET by using Blazor, which is Microsoft's response to that monopoly.

Blazor allows you to create a Single Page Application, on top of .NET Core and continue coding in C# (without needing to flip between C# and JavaScript too much). 

We will be exploring many intricacies of the Blazor life-cycle, data flow, JavaScript Interoperability and general development activities and nuances.

<h4> Content and Overview </h4>
To take this course, you will need to have some knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, if not C#. Even if you do not have much exposure to the .NET development stack, this course is very beginner friendly and chock full of development tips. 

This is a huge course. Over 15 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.

We don't do things the perfect way the first time; that is not the reality of writing code. We make mistakes and point them out and fix them around them. By doing this, we develop proficiency in using debugging tools and techniques. By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and impress your boss and coworkers.

The course is complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.
