 #### Content and Overview
To feel comfortable in this course, you will need some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. Beyond that, it is very beginner friendly, as we go through different programming structures using PHP. Even if you have no exposure to any web development, you will be able to follow along from scratch.Â  

This is a huge course. Over 10 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each feature in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.

By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, GitHub and MySQL, that it will become second nature for you when working on a future PHP project. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and impress your boss and coworkers.

The course is complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.
